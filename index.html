      <p>At my school (Eastside Preparatory School or EPS) we have this week of school called EBC week. EBC stands for education beyond the classroom. We have both EBC days and EBC week. EBC days are just field trips where my class goes out into the community to learn from experiences rather than simply reading out of a textbook. EBC week is where every EPS student gets to pick a trip that they will go on for a week. The fifth, sixth, and seventh graders don't get to pick a trip, the trip is already picked for them.

        <li>Santa Fe</li>
        <li>Yellowstone</li>
